## Our Team 
* Julie Ramsey (Data and Auto Analysis)
* Prashant Chintakindi (Identity Theft Analysis, Presentation deck and Readme)
* Sarah Dutton (Crime Analysis and Statitical Analysis)
     
## Project Description
Our group sought to uncover trends in crimes reported to Austin Police Department. Data was obtained from the city's public API to access all official police reports recorded in Austin throughout the period between 2003-2023. In this analysis, we have explored the dataset and gained insights into various aspects of crime in Austin. We used various Python libraries to analyze the data and create visualizations of our findings.

## Research Questions to Answer

* How do seasonal variations impact the occurrence of different types of crimes in Austin?
* How has crime evolved over the years as Austin continues to grow?
* Which seasons have the most occurrences of crime?

See included PowerPoint for summary of key findings and visualizations.

## Data Source
<https://data.austintexas.gov> (Crime Type, Occurance Dates). More details are available inside the Data folder of repo.

## Breakdown of Tasks
1. Get Datasets for Austin Crime
2. Clean the datasets. Keep only data between year 2003 to 2023.
3. Breakdown and Analyze Data Sets.
4. Crime Analysis
5. Auto Theft Analysis
6. Identity Theft Analysis
7. Conclusion

## Tools and Techniques:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib

## Hypothesis
H-Null: If seasons are not related to different drimes, then Winter months will not see an increase in crimes.
H-Alt: If seasons are related to different drimes, then Winter months will show an increase in crimes.

## Our Findings
* Seasons do influence crime in residential burglaries, auto thefts, bicycle thefts, and identity theft.
* Seasons do NOT impact shoplifting incidences
* The total number of crimes have been steadily decreasing.
* Overall, Austin may not necessarily be a violent city. This study might lend itself better to cities where violent crime is a major problem like Chicago.
